                <h3>Limit Order Book Simulator</h3>
                <p>
                    Implemented a limit order book and matching engine in C++ to explore
                    market microstructure.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Engineered a complete limit order book with price-time priority matching algorithm in C++
                        </li>
                        <li>Implemented efficient data structures (custom maps, priority queues) for O(log n) order</li>
                        operations
                        <li>Developed real-time trading interface with WebSocket communication and live market data</li>
                        <li>Built multithreaded architecture supporting high-frequency trading simulation</li>
                        <li>Created a professional frontend with real-time charts and order management</li>
                        <li>Designed modular system architecture with event-driven trade execution and callbacks</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>A recent project I'm really proud of is a Limit Order Book and Matching Engine I built in C++. It
                        began as an experiment to understand how real trading systems work but quickly grew into
                        something much more engaging. I designed it to handle limit and market orders, partial fills,
                        cancellations, and price-time priority all while keeping the implementation efficient and
                        readable. Seeing orders execute and match in real time felt like bringing a small-scale exchange
                        to life.
                        <br><br>
                        This project holds special significance because it pushed me well beyond my comfort zone. I had
                        to carefully consider performance, concurrency, and data structure design to make the system
                        both fast and reliable. Through it, I developed a much deeper appreciation for the complexity
                        behind modern trading infrastructure and gained confidence in writing high-performance,
                        production-style code. It also reinforced my interest in algorithmic trading and quantitative
                        systems development.

                        </li>
                        <li>Implemented event browsing, ID-based search, and language filtering using Swing
                            (javax.swing)
                            components, event listeners, and MVC-style structuring to improve user navigation.</li>
                        <li>Integrated secure payment options (PayPal, Credit Card) with real-time stock synchronisation
                            using
                            BufferedReader, BufferedWriter, file I/O streams, and custom toString() overrides for
                            receipt generation.</li>
                        <li>Applied core OOP principles - encapsulation, inheritance, interfaces, enums and utilised
                            Java collections,
                            exception handling, and modular class design to ensure scalability and maintainability.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>I built a role-based ticketing system in Java as part of my coursework at Loughborough University. The project aimed to simulate a real-world ticketing system for a performance hall, allowing users to purchase and manage tickets for events.
                        <br><br>
                        I began by designing the system using OOP principles to create a role-based ticketing system. I implemented a comprehensive event browsing, ID-based search, and language filtering using Swing components, event listeners, and MVC-style structuring to improve user navigation. This feature allowed users to easily find and purchase tickets for the events they wanted.
                        <br><br>
                        To manage the inventory, I used Java's data structures and file handling capabilities. I implemented secure payment options using BufferedReader, BufferedWriter, file I/O streams, and custom toString() overrides for receipt generation. This helped store managers keep track of the stock and ensure that popular items were always available.

                        <li>Worked with Docker (containers, volumes) and TablePlus for SQL database management.</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>During my internship at TruTrade Group, I developed a mental health and mood-tracking feature for
                        the company's web platform. The challenge was to design a system that could help users monitor
                        their wellbeing and receive meaningful insights, but the business requirements were initially
                        vague and ambiguous. There was no clear definition of what “improving mental health engagement”
                        meant or how success would be measured. This ambiguity forced me to rely heavily on data and
                        feedback to drive decisions and validate my own design choices, while also integrating DevOps
                        practices to ensure the feature could be deployed and iterated on reliably.
                        <br><br>
                        I began by building a daily check-in feature for the users using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP.
                        I collected the user interaction data to understand the wellbeing of the users. The dataset
                        included both quantitative metrics such as daily check-in frequency and average session
                        duration, and qualitative feedback about the user experience. My goal was to use this data to
                        shape the feature's design, focusing on how to increase participation and retention over time.
                        Alongside this, I containerised parts of the workflow using Docker to create consistent
                        development environments and streamline testing.
                        <br><br>
                        To analyse the data, I used Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib for pattern
                        recognition and to visualise charts for each specific user. In order to persist the user data, I
                        used TablePlus and SQL for structured database queries, and later introduced dashboards to track
                        engagement metrics over the development cycle. As the platform's infrastructure grew, I gained
                        exposure to CI/CD pipelines and Kubernetes, learning how container orchestration and automated
                        deployments support scalable and maintainable feature rollouts.
                        <br><br>
                        Based on this, I introduced data-driven prompts, for example showing motivational quotes or
                        tailored wellness messages based on a user's emotional state. Further down the line, I designed
                        five interactive mood states: happy, neutral, sad, bored, and anxious, each offering a tailored
                        experience such as mini-games, break time, journalling and more. Each state had unique logic for
                        updating user points and tracking engagement data. This ensured that user retention remained
                        strong throughout the feature, with DevOps tools helping me continuously test and release
                        updates with minimal disruption.
                        <br><br>
                        As the feature developed, the analytics revealed clear engagement spikes in the happy and bored
                        states; users appreciated activities that were immediate and interactive. I used this data to
                        iterate the design and prioritise features that maintained consistent user participation. After
                        launch, the feature increased daily check-in activity by over 25% and improved session retention
                        across the site.
                        <br><br>
                        This experience taught me that ambiguity can drive innovation when guided by data. By breaking
                        the project into smaller goals, testing hypotheses, and validating each stage with real user
                        behaviour, I gained confidence in both technical decision-making and infrastructure awareness.
                        It strengthened my communication skills, as I presented to both technical and non-technical
                        stakeholders.
                        <br><br>
                        Data is fundamental to Technology Management because it converts uncertainty into clarity and
                        supports decisions that balance business goals with user experience. I believe this mindset,
                        supported by DevOps practices and an understanding of scalable infrastructure, would allow me to
                        make a positive contribution from day one.
